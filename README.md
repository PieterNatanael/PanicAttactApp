# PanicAttactApp
The PanicAttackApp is an iOS application developed in SwiftUI that provides support for individuals experiencing panic attacks. It offers a simple and user-friendly interface to help users manage and communicate their distress during a panic attack.

Features
* Panic Attack Mode: With just one press of a button, the app enters Panic Attack Mode, displaying a message that reads, "Excuse me, I am having a panic attack."
* Calming Sounds: In Panic Attack Mode, the app plays soothing nature sounds and bird chirping to help the user relax and regain composure.
* User-Friendly Interface: The app's button dynamically changes to "I'm done" in Panic Attack Mode, making it easy for users to exit the mode when they feel ready.



How It Works
* 		Start: Press the main button to enter Panic Attack Mode.
* 		Panic Attack Mode: The app displays a message, "Excuse me, I am having a panic attack," along with calming nature sounds.
* 		Exiting Panic Attack Mode: When you are ready to exit Panic Attack Mode, press the button labeled "I'm done."
* 		Return to Normal: The app returns to its initial state.

Technology Stack:
* 		Swift programming language: The core programming language used to develop applications for various Apple platforms.
* 		SwiftUI framework: A user interface toolkit that enables the creation of modern and intuitive user interfaces for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications.
* 		Xcode: An integrated development environment (IDE) provided by Apple for building, testing, and deploying software across their platforms. It includes tools for coding, debugging, and interface design.

What I've Learned:
* 		Building intuitive user interfaces from the ground up.
* 		Creating modifiable, maintainable, and well-tested code.
* 		Investigating and solving issues with bugs and data inconsistencies.
